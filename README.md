## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transcribeflow.git
cd transcribeflow
```

### 2. Create & activate a virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Whisper also requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to be installed on your system.
> - **Windows:** `winget install ffmpeg` or download from the website
> - **macOS:** `brew install ffmpeg`
> - **Linux:** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### 4. Set up environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and edit:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password
SMTP_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
APP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> **Gmail setup:** Go to **Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords** and generate a 16-character app password. Use that as `SMTP_PASSWORD` — never your actual Gmail password.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)** in your browser.

## 📦 Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` with:

```
flask
openai-whisper
deep-translator
fpdf2
arabic-reshaper
python-bidi
passlib[argon2]
PyJWT
transformers
torch
python-dotenv
```

> First run will automatically download the Whisper `base` model (~150 MB) and BART model (~1.6 GB). Ensure you have a stable internet connection and enough disk space.

## ⚙️ Configuration Reference

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server address | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port | `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | Your email address | — |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | App password (not your login password) | — |
| `SMTP_FROM` | Sender address shown in email | Same as `SMTP_USER` |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Base URL for reset links | `http://127.0.0.1:5000` |

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with **Argon2** (resistant to brute-force attacks)
- Password reset tokens are single-use and expire after 30 minutes
- JWT tokens expire after 6 hours
- Never commit your `.env` file — it is listed in `.gitignore`
- The `users.json` file contains hashed passwords — also excluded from git

---

## 📝 .env.example

Include this file in your repo so others know what variables to set:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
SMTP_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
APP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: The app loads but transcription never completes.**
A: Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed and accessible in your system PATH.

**Q: I'm not receiving the password reset email.**
A: Double-check your `SMTP_PASSWORD` is a Gmail App Password (not your account password), and that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account.

**Q: Can I use a different email provider?**
A: Yes — update `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_PORT` in your `.env` to match your provider (e.g. Outlook uses `smtp.office365.com` on port `587`).

**Q: The BART model takes a long time to load.**
A: The model (~1.6 GB) is loaded into memory at startup. This is a one-time cost per server restart. Consider running on a machine with at least 4 GB RAM.

**Q: How do I deploy this to production?**
A: Use a WSGI server like **Gunicorn** behind **Nginx**, set `APP_BASE_URL` to your domain in `.env`, and use HTTPS so that reset links are secure.
